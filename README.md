# ReadMeGen

![README.md Generator]()

## Description
I have created a READme.md generator command line app, which when given imput by the user generates a unique and quick READme.md file for their project. 

When a user enters the project title, it's displayed as the title of the README.

When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.When a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents, they are taken to the corresponding section of the README.
